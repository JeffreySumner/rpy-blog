# Face of a Superstar: Part 1 (Data Gathering)

This post focuses on gathering data for the MLB Hall of Fame project. It is a **Pure R** project.

## Environment Setup

### R Dependencies (`renv`)

This project uses `renv` for R dependency management, configured to use **Posit Package Manager** for fast binary package installations on Windows.

1.  Open the project in RStudio (or set the working directory to this folder).
2.  Restore the R environment:
    ```r
    renv::restore()
    ```

## Running the Project

This is a standard Quarto document. You can render it directly provided the R packages are installed. No specific Python environment is required.
